<h1>Let's Hit the Road!</h1>
<p>There's not much I enjoy more than a winter road trip across the American West. The warm weather, interesting flora and fauna, and miles of untouched public lands draw me westward year after year. I believe the most attractive destinations are our country's National Parks. They provide outstanding views, educational visitor centers and a respite from chaos when it is needed. The Parks also provide great trails for running, hiking and adventure.</p>
<h2>About the National Park System</h2>

</div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nps.gov/index.htm">National Park Service</a>, a bureau of the Department of the Interior, operates 61 parks within the United States. Yosemite National Park was the first, designated in 1872 by President Ullyses S. Grant. The current parks are spread across twenty nine states and the territories of American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In total, the parks protect more than 52 million acres of land.</p>
<p>The National Park Service was created by Congress in 1916. That year, President Woodrow Wilson signed a bill that mandated the agency "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations." Yellowstone, as well as the second National Park, Mackinac Island in Michigan, were supervised and improved by the existing nearby Army troops. In 2017, the NPS employed more than 20,000 people and relied on the services of 315,000 volunteers.</p>
<p>I have made an effort to see many of the National Parks in Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Montana and California. Here are some of my favorite memories:</p>
<h3>Grand Canyon National Park</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Designated in 1919</li>
	<li>Comprises 1,217,262 acres</li>
	<li>Located in northern Arizona</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been to the Grand Canyon three times, including trips to the North and South Rims. During each visit, I have run a version of the Rim-to-River trails down into the canyon, then back up to the edge. The Bright Angel Trail from the South Rim is approximately 16 miles roundtrip. The elevation from the Rim drops 4,380 feet down to the Colorado River.</p>

<h3>Zion National Park</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Designated in 1919</li>
	<li>Comprises 146,597 acres</li>
	<li>Located in southwestern Utah</li>
</ul>
<p>I have visited Zion twice. My favorite trail in the Park is Angel's Landing, a 5 mile roundtrip with a 1,500 foot climb. Many chain handrails are installed to keep hiker's steady, but the narrow and high path isn't not for the faint of heart; the NPS officially recognizes eight deaths due to falling from the trail. Angel's Landing ends with a marvelous view of the entire Zion Canyon.</p>

<h3>Bryce Canyon National Park</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Designated in 1928</li>
	<li>Comprises 35,835 acres</li>
	<li>Located in southwestern Utah</li>
</ul>
<p>Bryce Canyon is quite small for a National Park. People are attracted to the area to see the famous hoodoo formations. The bright red, orange, and white rock layers have been eroded by frost and precipitation, causing numerous natural spires of rock. Some of the best views of the amphitheater of hoodoos are from Sunset Point, on the southern end of the Park.</p>

<h3>Arches National Park</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Designated in 1929</li>
	<li>Comprises 76,679 acres</li>
	<li>Located in southeastern Utah</li>
</ul>
<p>Arches is close to Moab, Utah, one of my favorite places to visit. I try to get to Moab three or four times per year to enjoy the warm weather and unique landscape. Within the park, more than 2,000 natural sandstone arches attract visitors. The high, forested La Sal mountains often provide a snowy backdrop for the red rocky formation. Many of trails to the famous arches are short; a vehicle is necessary to get between trailheads.</p>

<h3>Joshua Tree National Park</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Designated in 1994</li>
	<li>Comprises 790,636 acres</li>
	<li>Located in southeastern California</li>
</ul>
<p>As I type, I am camping outside the southern entrance to Joshua Tree National Park. I have not yet been inside but have had this location on my wish list for years. I hope to go running on some quiet trails and learn about the famous trees and geologic formations.</p>
